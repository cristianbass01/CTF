Challenge: Knock knock (https://trojanc.tf/challenges#Knock%20knock-8)

Following suspicious activity from one of our company's computers, we recorded its network traffic. 
Analyzing the resulting file, we noticed that it is communicating with a specific address, but the packets it sends are empty. 
Our suspicion is that it is trying to secretly send data to this address. 
Can you confirm this?

+ file knock-knock.pcap

Solution: 
Recover the destination ports since they look suspiciously like integers that can be converted to ascii:

$ tshark -r knock-knock.pcap -T fields -e tcp.dstport | tr '\t' '\n' | grep -E '^[0-9]+$' | awk '{printf "%c", $1}'

From the link we find: VHJvamFue2gxZDFuZ18xbmYwXzFuX3AwMjdfbnVtYjMyNX0=
That is probably base64: Trojan{h1d1ng_1nf0_1n_p027_numb325}

Challenge: UPS delivery (https://trojanc.tf/challenges#UPS%20delivery-10)

My friend gave me this binary. They said they got it through UPS or something?? 
I didn't know they deliver software now, but thats kinda cool! 
Anyways, it's a password checking program, but I forgot to ask for the password to test it... 
Can you help me find it?
